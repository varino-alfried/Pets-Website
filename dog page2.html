                <p>The Afador is a mixed breed dog across between the Afghan Hound and Labrador Retriever dog breeds. Loyal, energetic, and affectionate, these pups inherited some of the best qualities from both of their parents.Afadors are also sometimes known as the Afghan Lab. You can find these mixed breed dogs in shelters and breed specific rescues, so remember to always adopt! Do not shop if you are looking to add an Afador to your home!Afadors make excellent family pets, although they do better with older children and seasoned dog owners who can give the breed the training and attention they require. Afadors also make for good guard dogs, and they are alert to strangers. The mixed breed is very energetic and athletic, so access to a safe outdoor space is preferred.</p>

                <p>Bulldogs can be stubborn and lazy. Your mature Bulldog may not be very enthusiastic about going to a walk, but it's important that he is exercised every day to keep him fit.Bulldogs can't tolerate heat and humidity. When your Bulldog is outdoors, watch him carefully for signs of overheating and take him inside immediately if he starts to show distress. Some people put kiddy play pools filled with water in a shaded spot for their Bulldogs to lie in when the weather is warm and everyone is outside. They definitely are housedogs and should not live outdoors all of the time.Bulldogs' short noses make them prone to a number of respiratory ailments.</p>

                <p>Boxer dogs were originally bred to be medium-size guard dogs. Today, although they are a part of the AKC's Working Group, Boxers mostly find homes as loving family companions. That said, they still retain their high energy levels and need plenty of exercise.Square-jawed and muscular, this breed is the George Clooney of the dog world-a looker with a sense of humor and an underlying sweetness. They adore their families and will also appreciate consistent training that doesn't rely on harsh reprimands.If you're looking for a high-energy, easy-to-groom, family-friendly pooch, then this just may be the breed for you!</p>
