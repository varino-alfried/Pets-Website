                    Is it really necessary to bring my dog and/or cat in for a yearly comprehensive exam?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Comprehensive examinations are recommended AT LEAST annually to check for health issues that may not be apparent to owners. During a comprehensive examination the veterinarian will examine your pet's eyes, ears, skin and hair coat, listen to their heart, and discuss any concerns you may have.

                    What is the difference between an annual exam and a bi-annual Wellness visit - and should I sign my pet up for a Wellness Package?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    During an annual exam, a veterinarian will examine the pet from head to tail including eyes, ears, mouth, heart/lung sounds, skin/haircoat, etc. At this time, the veterinarian will discuss any concerns clients have as well as discuss any unknown issues noted during the exam. Some illnesses/medical concerns can be detected during a comprehensive pet exam, but more serious conditions might go undetected without proper testing and diagnostic treatment. A wellness visit. The Wellness Package includes additional tests and services above the annual pet exam at a discounted cost. These tests give us the ability to check the complete health of your pet allowing us to identify any potential health problems before they become serious. Because the services and tests are discounted, it makes complete care more affordable. For this reason, we do recommend that our clients select the wellness package for their pets.

                    Does heartworm prevention and flea prevention need to be given year round?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Yes! Mosquitos and fleas are both present year round across the United States, but especially in the Gulf Coast region where temperatures remain warm for much of the year. Heartworm incidence in this region is still very high making year round heartworm prevention paramount.

                    What dog and cat food brands do you recommend?
                </h3>
                <P>
                    There are many great brands out there. The ones we recommend the most based on years of results and healthy dogs and cats. It is recommended that pets are fed premium diets like Purina, Science Diet, Iams and Eukanuba. Occasionally, prescription diets are recommended based on a pet's specific needs. Our Veterinarians will make these recommendations when appropriate.

                    When do I switch from puppy/kitten food to adult food?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Switching a puppy or kitten to adult food too early can cause obesity and gastro-intestinal issues. We recommend switching to adult dog or cat food between 10-12 months.

                <p>
                    If there is an emergency during business hours, simply call our closest location ahead of time so we know what to expect and bring your pet in.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    If no skin condition is present, you can bathe your dog every 4-6 weeks.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    While we do not promote declawing of all cats, we recognize that there are certain times and situations that declawing may be necessary for the health and safety of the cat and family. In order to ensure the best outcome, we use Co2 laser or all de-claws, keep them overnight for observation, and provide comprehensive pain control.

                    We just found a stray pet. What should we do?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Check the pet for collar/tags. If none present, feel free to drop by one of our offices to check the pet for a microchip. If no microchip is present, it is recommended that the pet be kept safe while you look for signs in the area found and post on/check websites such as woodlands online, Montgomery Country Animal Shelter, and Pet Harbor for lost pet listings that meet the description.

                    When do you need fecal samples, and why?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    It is recommended that a fecal sample be provided at annual/wellness visits, new puppy/kitten exams, and when GI symptoms are present. Only tapeworms and roundworms are visible to the naked eye. On some occasions diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss are symptoms of intestinal worms but many intestinal parasites go undetected without running intestinal parasite tests. Some intestinal parasites are zoonotic, meaning they are transmittable to humans making routine intestinal parasite testing important to the health of pets AND humans.
