                <h2>Huskydoodle</h2> <b>The Huskydoodle</b>  is a mixed breed dog-a cross between the Siberian Husky and Poodle dog breeds. Highly intelligent, full of energy, and sociable, these pups inherited some of the best traits from both of their parents.</br><b>Huskydoodles</b> go by several names, including Siberpoo, Poosky, Siberian Poodle, and Huskypoo. Despite their unfortunate status as a designer breed, you may find these mixed breed dogs in shelters and breed specific rescues </br><b>These</b> incredibly active pups make great dogs for equally active owners. While they can thrive with a high-energy person in an urban environment, they are best suited to households with a larger amount of space, like a yard, and more than one human. If you want a playful dog who will make sure you get your steps in-all while loving you unconditionally-this may be the right dog for you!</br><b>The Huskydoodle</b> is a mixed breed dog. They are not purebreds like their Siberian Husky or Poodle parents.</br><b>The main</b> colors of Huskydoodles are black, gray, and white. Sometimes they will take on some of the Poodle parent's coloring, such as apricot, red, or brown, although this is less common. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors.</br><b>Huskydoodles</b> make excellent family dogs, as they are highly sociable and fairly tolerant of accidental rough play from younger children. Always supervise play time.</br><b>Make sure</b> your Huskydoodle gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and some shorter walks mixed in.

            <h2>Labrador Retriever</h2><b>The Labrador</b> Retriever was bred to be both a friendly companion and a useful working dog breed. Historically, they earned their keep as fishermen's helpers: hauling nets, fetching ropes, and retrieving fish from the chilly North Atlantic.</br><b>Today's Lab</b> is as good-natured and hardworking as their ancestors, and they're also America's most popular breed. Modern Labs work as retrievers for hunters, assistance dogs, show competitors, and search and rescue dogs, among other canine jobs.</br><b>DogTime</b> recommends this dog bed to give a good night's sleep to your medium-sized Lab. You should also pick up this dog de-shedder for your high shedding pup!</br><b>Labrador</b> Retrievers love, love, love to eat, and become obese very quickly if overfed. Limit treats, give your Lab plenty of exercise, and measure out regular meals rather than leaving food out all the time. And be warned that the Lab's large appetite extends to people food and even inedible items. Labradors will forage in garbage, counter surf, and can make a meal out of chewed-up items like children's toys.</br><b>Labrador Retrievers</b> were bred for physically demanding jobs, and they have the high energy that goes along with being a working breed. They need at least 30 to 60 minutes of exercise a day. Without it, they can vent their pent-up energy in destructive ways, such as barking and chewing.

            <h2>Mastiff</h2><b>The Mastiff</b> is one of the most ancient types of dog breeds. Their ancestor, the Molossus, was known 5,000 years ago. Back then, they were ferocious war dogs, very different from the benevolent behemoth that the breed is today.</br><b>Mastiffs</b> are sometimes called Old English Mastiffs. Although this is a purebred dog, you may find them in shelters and rescues.</br><b>Mastiffs</b> make fine companions for anyone who can accommodate their great size and doesn't mind a little drool slung here and there. Apartment dwellers and first-time dog owners may want to consider another breed. But if you're looking for a big dog with lots of love to give, this may be the pooch for you!</br><b>DogTime</b> recommends this big, spacious crate to give your big Mastiff a place to rest and relax. You should also pick up this dog brush and massager for your short-haired pup!</br><b>Without</b> exercise and stimulation, Mastiffs can become bored and destructive.</br><b>The Mastiff</b> is considered a breed with a short lifespan, but some Mastiffs have lived to 18 years of age. A dog is a lifelong commitment, and if you are drawn to the breed because of the chance of a short lifespan, you may want to reassess your choice.</br><b>Mastiffs</b> are not the best choice for families with very young children or frail senior citizens. A Mastiff can easily knock down a child or adult who's unsteady.</br><b>Mastiffs</b> have an easy-care coat, but they shed heavily.

            <h2>Shih-poo</h2><b>The Shih-Poo</b> is a mixed breed dog - a cross between the Shih Tzu and Toy Poodle dog breeds. Small, hypoallergenic and cuddly companions, these pups inherited some of the best qualities from both of their parents.</br><b>Shih-Poos</b> also go by the names Shoodle or Pooshi, but don't confuse them with the Poo-Shi, the Poodle/Shiba Inu mix. Despite their status as a designer breed, you may find these mixed breed dogs in shelters and rescues.</br><b>Shih-Poos</b> make great companion animals for just about anyone, but a retired senior would most likely be an ideal match. They love to be doted on, pampered, and loved. They are pretty versatile and can thrive in almost any environment-family home, apartment, or tiny house in the middle of nowhere.</br><b>Single person,</b> or family, just make sure your Shih-Poo gets lots of love and attention. Shih-Poos should never be kept outside and will require regular vet check ups, dental cleanings, and grooming. Frequent potty breaks can also help if they inherit their Shih Tzu parents' propensity for stubbornness and territorial marking.</br><b>Shih-Poos</b> can come in black, white, brown, brindle, and all variations and color combinations.</br><b>Like most small dogs,</b> Shih-Poos can be prone to dental health issues. Maintain proper dental hygiene for your Shih-Poo.</br><b>Shih-Poos</b> are pretty versatile and can live in just about any kind of home. They're happy to engage in active play or take a snooze on their humans' laps.
